# Assignment 1
Shape and Point Calculation Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of classes Point and Shape to perform geometric calculations. Using these classes, you can calculate the perimeter of a shape, find the longest side, and compute the average side length of a shape based on a series of points.

## Features

- Define a Point with x and y coordinates.
- Calculate the distance between two points.
- Use the Shape class to:
- Add points that define a shape.
- Calculate the perimeter of the shape.
- Find the longest side of the shape.
- Calculate the average side length.
